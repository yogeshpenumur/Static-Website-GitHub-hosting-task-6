## Project Title
Infinite Loop - Static Website Hosting with GitHub Pages

## Project Description
This repository hosts a static website, "Infinite Loop," deployed using GitHub Pages. The website is based on a free CSS template from Tooplate. This project demonstrates the process of setting up and deploying a simple HTML website via GitHub Pages, following the task guidelines.

## Task Objective
Deploy a simple HTML website using GitHub Pages.

## Tools
* GitHub Pages
* HTML
* CSS (Tooplate template: Infinite Loop - 2117)
* Template Link : https://www.tooplate.com/view/2117-infinite-loop
  

## Deliverables
* Live website link (to be updated once deployed)
* GitHub repository

## Steps To Doing The Task

1.  **Create an `index.html` file:** This is the main entry point for your website. You will integrate the content from the "Infinite Loop" template here.
2.  **Push it to a new GitHub repo:** Create a new repository on GitHub and upload all your website files (HTML, CSS, JS, images from the template) to it.
3.  **Go to repo → Settings → Pages → enable GitHub Pages:** Navigate to your repository settings and find the "Pages" section.
4.  **Select `main` branch and `root` folder:** Configure GitHub Pages to deploy from your `main` branch (or `master`, depending on your repo's default) and select the `root` directory as the source.
5.  **Access live website from the link GitHub gives:** After saving the settings, GitHub will provide a URL where your website is live. It might take a few minutes for the deployment to complete.
